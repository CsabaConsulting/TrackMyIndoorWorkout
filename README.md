# Track My Indoor Workout

## Features

* The app supports [Precor Spinner® Chrono™ Power](https://www.precor.com/en-us/commercial/cardio/indoor-cycling/spinner-chrono-power).
* It picks up the watt meter and the pedal cadence readings unlike Wahoo Fitness app's [Precor Spinner® Chrono™ Power](https://www.precor.com/en-us/commercial/cardio/indoor-cycling/spinner-chrono-power) integration.
* On top of that the app supplies GPS data as well: it emulates a virtual ride as if the user would circle on the Hoover High School running track.
* The app is capable of uploading the workout to Strava and would also offer TCX file download for in-app purchase.
